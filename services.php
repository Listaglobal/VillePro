                            <p>
                                We at Dorchester services have got well over 20 years frontline work experience supporting as well as 
                                managing people who are dealing with the trauma and stress that is experienced when they are victims of assault, 
                                false allegations and other incidents that impact on their well-being.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mt-30">
                                The burning questions that a lot of people seek answers to are: when the trauma of an assault leads to hospitalisation 
                                and sickness from work due to injuries, flashbacks, depression and other forms of disablement that have now restricted 
                                their working life, What do you do? You write statements, you may receive a letter, phone call, visit from an elected 
                                person from work (not necessarily a manager); You may be referred to occupational health for a couple of free counselling 
                                sessions but what happens when they have ceased?
                            </p>
                            <p class="mt-30">
                                More so, you are left alone with family members/ friends who do not understand. Your colleagues or mates stay in touch 
                                for a while but then you push them away. Management gets in touch when they just want to know when you are returning as 
                                they have policies to follow, and the options go on an on . . .
